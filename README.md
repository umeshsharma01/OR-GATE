# OR-GATE
An OR gate is a fundamental digital logic gate that performs logical addition. 
It has two or more input signals and one output signal. 
The output of the OR gate becomes high (1) when at least one of the input signals is high and the output becomes low (0) only when all inputs are low.
In Boolean algebra, the OR operation is represented by the plus (+) symbol.
